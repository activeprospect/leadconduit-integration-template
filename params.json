{"name":"LeadConduit Integration Template","tagline":"LeadConduit integration code template","body":"# LeadConduit Integration Scaffold\r\n\r\nUse this module as a starting-place template for LeadConduit integrations. It includes standard structure and example code for both inbound and outbound integrations. \r\n\r\nLearn more about the [LeadConduit platform](http://activeprospect.com/products/leadconduit/).\r\n\r\n## Customization steps \r\n\r\n1. Make a copy of this entire project. \r\n2. If you cloned it from github, delete the `.git` directory, and then run `git init` to create a new repo\r\n3. run `npm install` to install the default node modules needed to start development\r\n4. run `cake test` - this scaffold includes a dummy `test` task that searches for text substitutions you haven't made yet. Replace all the instances of \"service_being_integrated\" with the name of the service you're making an integration for. Once that's done, delete that task from `Cakefile` and uncomment the real `test` task, which should have all passing tests to start with. Get used to writing tests and executing them with `cake test`. **Your integration will not be added to the LeadConduit platform without adequate test coverage.**\r\n5. Integrations may be made for requests that are \"inbound\" to LeadConduit, or for posts that are \"outbound\" from LeadConduit, or both. Customize or delete the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) files in the `src` and `spec` directories as needed.\r\n6. create a Github repository and push your code\r\n7. _review by ActiveProspect, changes or fixes as necessary_\r\n8. _module is published to [npm](https://npmjs.org/)_\r\n9. _module is made available in LeadConduit_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Delete this line and everything above when your integration module is ready to publish._\r\n\r\n\r\n# LeadConduit Service-Being-Integrated Integration\r\n\r\nThis module is for use on the LeadConduit platform.
